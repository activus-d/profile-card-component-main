### What I learned

In this project I learned the use of background position and I'm also proud of how I used flex-box to align the card vertically along the page-flow.



### Continued development

I would love to practice more on the use media queries so as to make my web-page more responsive. I also need to learn more about the various background properties.

### Useful resources

http://www.w3schools.com helped me with the various use of the background properties
